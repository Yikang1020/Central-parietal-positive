If possible, this folder includes all the material presented to the participants (or as-close-aspossible reproductions thereof) as well as, e.g., the software used to present the stimuli and user documentation. The source of this material should be  documented, and any licensing restrictions should be noted in a the readme file. In the example project (https://osf.io/xf6ug/), we provide the experimental software used for stimulus presentation and response collection, and the stimuli that we are legally able to share. License information on reuse is included in the README file.
