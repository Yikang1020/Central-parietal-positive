This folder includes the original data, in the “rawest” possible form. These could, for example, be individual e-prime files, databases extracted from online survey software, or scans of questionnaires. If this form is not directly exploitable, a processed version (e.g., in CSV format) that can be imported by any user should be included, in an appropriately labeled folder. For example, raw questionnaire responses as encoded could be made available in this format. Ideally, both versions of the data (i.e., before and after being made “importable”) are included. In the example project (https://osf.io/xf6ug/), we provide raw text files saved by the experimental software for each participant. A file containing a description of each dataset should also be included (see section on data documentation).
