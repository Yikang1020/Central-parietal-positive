This can coincide with the preregistration document or the method section of the research report. In the example project (https://osf.io/xf6ug/), which is a registered report, we provide the full document as accepted in-principle at stage 1. If the study protocol or the preregistration consist of multiple files (e.g., analysis scripts or protocols of power analyses) these documents can placed in a Study protocol-folder together with the description of the study protocol.
